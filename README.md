## Things I would like to add
## Back-end:
 - CI/CD file for the git platform I'm using (Travis - Github, GitlabCI Gitlab, Pipelines - Bitbucket, or even a CircleCI or Jenkins configuration), this facilitates development in a way we would assure some parts of our code are not broken because of updates
 - Swagger documentation, so anyone that wanted to consume the API would only view a beautilful file with an intuitive layout
 - Integration tests with the cloud provider, mostly to test permissions to methods, and view if resources are available
 - Infrastructure as code file, such as Terraform or Cloudformation Stack, so it would be easier to deploy and update structures as we develop. With that there would be the need to develop a series of scripts to deploy the app
 - Deployment jobs, so all the deploy in different environments, would be facilitated and configured only once, to be applied many times.
## Front-end:
 - CI/CD file for the git platform I'm using (Travis - Github, GitlabCI Gitlab, Pipelines - Bitbucket, or even a CircleCI or Jenkins configuration), this facilitates development in a way we would assure some parts of our code are not broken because of updates
 - Automated tests, so it would be easier to assure things appear at the correct time and space
 - Deployment jobs, so all the deploy in different environments, would be facilitated and configured only once, to be applied many times.
